\section{The problem}\label{the-problem}

Professor May B. Wright needs to fly from Baltimore (BWI) to Los Angeles
(LAX) to attend a conference. She thinks this would be the perfect
opportunity to accumulate some frequent flyer miles on American Airlines
(AA), where she already has Platinum status.

Looking into flights on AA, she sees that every itinerary from BWI to
LAX costs roughly the same. She has a full day to spare for travel, so
she wants to know: which sequence of AA domestic flights starting at BWI
and ending at LAX over the course of one day will allow her to
accumulate the most miles?

\begin{itemize}
  \item Suppose we have a database of every AA domestic flight on a given day.
  \item In particular, for each flight, we have:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item the flight number
      \item the origin airport
      \item the destination airport
      \item the departure time at the origin airport
      \item the arrival time at the destination airport
      \item the distance traveled in miles
    \end{itemize}
  \item How can we formulate Professor Wright's problem as a shortest path
    problem?
\end{itemize}
